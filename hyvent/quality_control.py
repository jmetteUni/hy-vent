def qc_lat_lon_IQR(profile, vars_to_qc, threshold, boxplots=False):        #qc on no of lat lon in a profile with the IQR method #threshold example =1.5
    """
    This function removes outliers based on the interquartile ranges method on selected lat lon coordinates in a dataframe. Optional, box plots are produced for controlling the outlier detection. If the selected variabels are acoustic tracker positions names "CTD_lat" or "CTD_lon", the corresponing coordinate for an outlier is also removed for consistency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    profile : pandas dataframe
        Data wich should be quality controlled.
    vars_to_qc : list of strings
        List of variables were outliers should be removed. If one of the is called "CTD_lat" or "CTD_lon" the corresponding coordinate to the outlier is also removed.
    threshold : int or float
        Threshold of the outlier removal, which defines the upper and lower bounds.
    boxplots : boolian, optional
        Boolian which controlles if boxplots are produced or not. The default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    profile: pandas dataframe
        Returns the data with outliers as NaN
