def corr_mapr_depth(data,lat):
    """

    Calculates a corrected depth based on the 200 first pressure values larger then 5 dB which are assumed as measured before deploying. The new, corrected depth is calculated with Gibbs Seawater Toolbox (gsw.conversions.z_from_p()) with the pressure corrected by the mean of the pre-deployment values and written to the dataframe as a new column.


    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pandas dataframe
        Data of one station of one MAPR as a pandas dataframe.
    lat : interger or float
        Latitude where the measurement was taken to calculate the depth from pressure.

    Returns
    -------
    depth_corr : pandas series
        Column containining the corrected depth.
